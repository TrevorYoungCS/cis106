  # Definitions
  ## File system
  * The way files are stored and organized 
  ## Pathname
  * Indicates the location of the file in the filesystem (like an address)
  ## Absolute path  
  * The location of a file starting at the root of the file system.
  ## Relative path 
  * The location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory   
  ## Your home directory 
  * User's personal directory where all your files are located.
  ## The home directory 
  * This is the parent directory og all the home directories. This is where all the users' home directory are. The absolute path of this directory is /home 
  ## Parent Directory  
  * a directory containing one or more directories and files 
  ## Child or sub Directory  
  * This is a directory inside another directory. See image for visual reference
  ## Bash Special characters 
  * function like commands that tell the shell to perform a specific action without having to type the complete command/ These special characters make working on the command line more efficient
  ## Environment variables   
  *  Environment variables store values of a user's environment and can be used in commands in the shell. These values can be unique to the user's environment which makes them ideal when writing commands that you want to use regales of which user is using the computer. To see a list of your environment variables type `env`. to use the value stored in an environment variable you must prepend the variable name with `$`.
  ## User Defined Variables    
  * In programming, a variable is place to store data. A variable is like a box with a label. For example, if you a lot of pens in your desk and you place them in a box a label it pens, now the box store your pens. In programming a variable can be used to store temporary or permanent information that you will continuously reuse in your program. For example, username='maria53' the variable name now stores the value maria. When evener the programs need to access the mariaâ€™s username, it can do it by referencing the variable username.
  ## Why do we need to use $ with variables in bash shell scripting?
  * To use the value stored in an environment variable you must prepend the variable name with a $.
